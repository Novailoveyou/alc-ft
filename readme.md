# Getting Started

## First run

Make sure you've got installed on your machine:

- Node.js
- pnpm
- Docker

Then open your terminal, navigate to desired folder and run the following command

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Novailoveyou/alc-ft.git alc-ft && cd ./alc-ft/innovapure.tube && pnpm run dev
```

## Next run

Next time you'd want to run local dev server, just navigate to the project folder and run

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Enjoy!
