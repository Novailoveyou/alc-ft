# Getting Started

## First steps

Make sure you've got installed on your machine:

- Node.js
- pnpm
- Docker

Then open your terminal, navigate to desired folder and run the following command

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Novailoveyou/alc-ft.git alc-ft

cd ./alc-ft/innovapure.tube

pnpm run init
```

Then create ./innovapure.tube/.env file and fill it in with env vars

## Run dev local server

Next time you'd want to run local dev server, just navigate to the project folder and run

```bash
pnpm dev
```

To view app in the browser go to https://localhost:3000

Enjoy!
